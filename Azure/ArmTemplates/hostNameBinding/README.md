## Deploy hostname binding

Designed to work as nested template for Sitecore, but could be used for any web app.
Will deploy hostname binding and associate it with certificate, if it is passed in deployment.

### Example

Following example are used to include as nested template in standard Sitecore deployment template (see [this](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore-Azure-Quickstart-Templates/blob/master/Sitecore%209.0.2/XP/azuredeploy.json) as example):

```json
```

Eventually, when I will add this one as nested template to other web app - I will add regular example as well.
