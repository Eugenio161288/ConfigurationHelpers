## Purpose

I will store here scripts used for Sitecore installation and configuration

### sitecore9SifHelper.ps1

This script could help in Sitecore 9 on-premises installation.

Generic web server preparation could be done with help of set of scripts in this very repo, which is launched from [server configuration script](https://github.com/akuryan/ConfigurationHelpers/blob/master/IIS/configure.server.cmd)
